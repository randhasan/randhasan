Hi!  I’m @randhasan.  I'm currently double-majoring in Finance and CS at the University of Pittsburgh.  On my GitHub, you can find a mixture of school projects, as well as personal ones using Python, Java, Javascript, HTML/CSS, C, and React.  Other languages I know are SQL, R, and Flutter.

To see some of my websites via video - please visit my website portfolio that I coded! -> https://randhasan.github.io/portfolio/

I'd love to work in tech, finance, strategy, marketing, or anywhere in between (especially within the entertainment, fashion, and beauty industries)!

To reach me, please shoot me an email at rhasan4@outlook.com!  For more information, you can also check out my LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/rand-hasan/
