- 👋 Hi, I’m @randhasan
- ⏰ In my free time, I love trying new food, listening to music, hanging out with my friends, and exercising.  I enjoy running as well as swimming.  Another passion of mine is fashion/beauty/marketing as I love keeping up with the newest trends and appreciating creative works of art.  I also believe there's a science within marketing and persuasion which fascinates me.
- 👀 I’m interested in Discrete Mathematics and coding in Java.  I also have a lot of experience in Python but have recently been doing a lot more projects and studying in Java.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying CS at the School of Computing and Information at the University of Pittsburgh.  In addition, I am enrolled in the Frederick Honors College.
